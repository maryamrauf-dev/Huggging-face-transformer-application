Hugging Face Transformers Applications
=> Overview

This project explores the power of Hugging Face Transformers for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
It demonstrates how pre trained transformer models (BERT, XLNet, DistilBERT, and BART) can perform sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, zero-shot classification, and sequence classification, all within a unified, practical workflow.

=> Key Features
 1. Sentiment Analysis
 2. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
 3. Zero Shot Text Classification
 4. Tokenization Exploration
 5. Sequence Classification with DistilBERT
